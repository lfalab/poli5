# POLI 5: Data Analytics for the Social Sciences

This repository contains R scripts and .Rmd files I designed for my course offerings of [POLI 5: Data Analytics for the Social Sciences](https://ucsdcloud-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/lfalabel_ucsd_edu/EZfG60b60XNPtdHGJ93FLxoBJG1jwj339LlK8_SVIvQPVg?e=7IoNAI
) at UC San Diego. 

My teaching adopts a flipped-classroom approach: Students watch pre-recorded lectures before each session; Lectures may contain [slides](https://ucsdcloud-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/lfalabel_ucsd_edu/Eoi6VC0dvSlEmMG_Lkh8UHsBVwrjQuvVLZqx4aSudmQ4vg?e=ybohRn), R code, or both, with students having access to such files beforehand. We spend minimal time reviewing lecture material in class. Sessions are mostly dedicated to [class activities](https://ucsdcloud-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/lfalabel_ucsd_edu/Ed4wEbE-D8hHlmu-vz1rIuYBghnxm4C-XA1KWFpvhwmuwA?e=D3pZjq).

## Folder Structure

- `answer-keys`: .Rmd files with answer keys to some of the class activities. The compiled documents can be downloaded [here](https://ucsdcloud-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/lfalabel_ucsd_edu/EinzEsk413dJvkF2yYWsuD4BLdsv15KQXTTsW34dv55b-g?e=DB8zuB).

- `code-lessons`: Companion code for lectures.

- `code-source`: Certain scripts in `code-lessons` involve steps necessary for completing tasks in the lecture, but that went beyond the learning outcomes at hand. On such occasions, I used `source()` to pull code from this folder, and explained to students that those interested in digging deeper had the option to check the code and see what was being done under the hood.

- `data`: When needed, scripts in `code-lessons` download .csv files in this folder.

- `homeworks`: .Rmd files with homework assignments and marking criteria. The compiled documents can be downloaded [here](https://ucsdcloud-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/lfalabel_ucsd_edu/EomsXRVW9ARJvEQST0gcBiUBS5A3h1--50RnGRuAIIzZPQ?e=Zq2bmk).
